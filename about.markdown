I am currently working as a Senior DevOps Engineer at JioCinema, where I manage large-scale cloud infrastructure. My primary focus is on Kubernetes, Prometheus, and optimizing infrastructure to handle high-traffic live events seamlessly. Whether it’s scaling clusters for IPL matches or fine-tuning CI/CD pipelines, I thrive on solving complex infrastructure challenges.

Beyond work, I maintain a home lab powered by Raspberry Pis, running a self-hosted cloud with K3s and Longhorn. This setup allows me to experiment with distributed systems and data persistence on a smaller scale. For personal storage, I use Ente as an alternative to Google Photos, ensuring privacy while keeping my media easily accessible across devices.

When I’m not managing production workloads or tinkering with my home lab, I dive into over-ambitious projects—ranging from analog computing to building a fully custom AI inference system. My interests span from optimizing deep learning models at the CUDA level to exploring novel ways to replace transistors with wave-based computation. It’s an ever-evolving journey fueled by curiosity and a passion for pushing the boundaries of computing.
