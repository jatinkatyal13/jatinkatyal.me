# Analog Computation for Large Language Models

Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally vast collections of matrix multiplications. Modern GPUs serve as highly optimized matrix-multiplication-addition engines, designed to accelerate these computations. However, digital computation is inherently constrained by memory bandwidth, power consumption, and latency. Can we achieve the same computations through analog means, leveraging superposition in electronics or even light? In this blog, we explore the intersection of physics and computing to rethink computation at scale.

## The Mathematics of LLMs

At their core, LLMs rely on matrix multiplications, which power everything from self-attention to fully connected layers:

$$ Y = XW + b $$

where:
- \( X \) is the input matrix,
- \( W \) is the weight matrix,
- \( b \) is the bias vector,
- \( Y \) is the output.

GPUs are optimized for this via thousands of parallel cores executing multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. However, the fundamental question remains: **Can we replace these digital circuits with a purely analog alternative?**

## Superposition in Electronics for Computation

Superposition, a principle from physics, states that multiple waves or signals can coexist and be independently manipulated. Analog electronics, particularly operational amplifiers and Gilbert cell multipliers, can exploit this principle:

1. **Multiplication using Gilbert Cells**: These transistor-based circuits exploit the inherent non-linearity of MOSFETs to perform analog multiplication.
   - Given two input signals \( V_x \) and \( V_y \), the Gilbert cell outputs a signal proportional to \( V_x V_y \), inherently performing element-wise multiplication.
   
   $$ V_{out} = k \cdot V_x V_y $$

2. **Summation via Op-Amps**: Summing multiple signals can be done using resistor networks and operational amplifiers.
   - Using Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL), the summing amplifier computes:
   
   $$ V_{out} = - (\frac{R_f}{R_1} V_1 + \frac{R_f}{R_2} V_2 + ... ) $$

3. **Weight Encoding Using Voltage or Current**: Instead of storing weights digitally, they can be represented as variable resistances or capacitor charge levels, allowing real-time adaptation of weights.

Thus, an analog circuit can be designed where input voltages (analog signals) are weighted and summed, naturally implementing the operations performed by a neural network layer.

### Circuit Implementation

Using a combination of Gilbert multipliers, summing amplifiers, and microcontrollers, we can design an analog equivalent of an MLP:

- **Input Encoding**: Signals are applied as voltages.
- **Weight Multiplication**: Gilbert multipliers scale input signals.
- **Summation**: Op-amp circuits aggregate values.
- **Non-linearity**: Diode-based or transistor-based circuits apply activation functions such as ReLU (approximated using rectifiers or MOSFET-based clamping circuits).

This approach can be extended to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) by chaining multiple layers of multipliers and summation circuits.

## Optical Computing: Leveraging Light for Matrix Operations

An alternative approach is using light interference for computation. Light naturally performs Fourier transforms through diffraction, making it an excellent candidate for convolution and matrix multiplication.

### Young’s Double-Slit Experiment for Computation

Interference patterns can encode and decode data through phase modulation. A setup using:
- **Multiple laser sources** to encode input data.
- **Phase-modulating materials** to represent weight matrices.
- **Photodiodes** to capture the computed values.

can be used to perform optical matrix multiplications at nearly the speed of light.

Mathematically, if we let \( E(x,t) \) represent an electric field at position \( x \), then the intensity at a given point from interfering beams follows:

$$ I = |E_1 e^{i\phi_1} + E_2 e^{i\phi_2} + ... |^2 $$

where \( \phi \) represents phase shifts corresponding to weights in the multiplication.

### Implementation with Digital Micromirror Devices (DMDs)

DMDs, arrays of tiny mirrors that reflect light directionally, can be used for programmable optical computing:
- **Input Encoding**: Laser beams pass through a phase mask representing the input.
- **Weight Representation**: A DMD modulates the phase and intensity of light.
- **Summation via Interference**: The resulting beams interfere to produce the weighted sum at photodetectors.

This setup enables massively parallel computations with minimal energy consumption compared to GPUs.

This work aims to bridge **computational theory and experimental physics**, leveraging new methods for ultra-efficient AI computation. Let’s push the boundaries of how we compute!
